    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search CV in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. The goal is to improve model performance by systematically exploring a specified grid of hyperparameter combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify the Hyperparameter Grid: Define a set of hyperparameters and their possible values to search through.\n",
    "Cross-Validation: For each combination of hyperparameters, the model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation (typically k-fold CV). This involves splitting the dataset into k subsets (folds), training the model on k-1 folds, and validating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times.\n",
    "Evaluate Performance: The performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) for each hyperparameter combination are averaged across the k folds.\n",
    "Select the Best Hyperparameters: The combination that yields the best performance is chosen as the optimal set of hyperparameters.\n",

    "Q2. Describe the difference between grid search CV and randomized search CV, and when might you choose one over the other?\n",
    "Grid Search CV systematically evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters in the specified grid, while Randomized Search CV randomly samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations from the grid and evaluates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exhaustiveness: Grid Search CV is exhaustive, meaning it evaluates all possible combinations, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially with large grids. Randomized Search CV, on the other hand, explores a subset of the grid, making it faster but potentially less thorough.\n",
    "Efficiency: Randomized Search CV is more efficient in scenarios where you have a large hyperparameter space because it can find a good combination without needing to evaluate every possible option.\n",
    "When to Choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV: Use when the hyperparameter space is small and you want to evaluate all combinations, or when accuracy is critical, and you have the computational resources to do so.\n",
    "Randomized Search CV: Use when the hyperparameter space is large, or when you want to quickly find a good, but not necessarily the best, set of hyperparameters.\n",

    "Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "Data Leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates during training. This happens when the model accidentally has access to information that it wouldn't have in a real-world scenario, which can cause it to make predictions that seem accurate but are actually based on leaked information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It‚Äôs a Problem:\n",
    "Data leakage leads to models that perform well during training but fail to generalize to new, unseen data. This can result in poor performance when the model is deployed in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you're building a model to predict whether a patient will develop a certain disease. If the training dataset includes a feature that indicates whether the patient is already taking medication for the disease (which would only be known if the disease is already diagnosed), the model might learn to rely on this feature to make predictions. This is data leakage because in real-world scenarios, you wouldn't have this information before making the prediction.\n",

    "Q4. How can you prevent data leakage when building a machine learning model?\n",
    "Preventing Data Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper Data Splitting: Ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are properly separated. Information from the validation or test sets should not be used during training.\n",
    "Avoid Feature Leakage: Make sure that no features in the training data contain information that wouldn‚Äôt be available at the time of prediction. For example, if you're predicting future sales, don‚Äôt include data from the same period in your training features.\n",
    "Temporal Considerations: In time series data, ensure that future data is not used to predict past events. The model should only have access to past data when making predictions.\n",
    "Pipeline Management: If you're performing operations like scaling or encoding, ensure these transformations are fitted only on the training data and then applied to the validation/test sets to prevent information from leaking.\n",
