    "Q1. Describe the Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm and How It Works to Make Predictions.\n",
    "A Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm builds a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree Structure: The decision tree is structured as a series of nodes connected by branches. Each internal node represents a \"decision\" based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a final classification or output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the Data: The tree is built by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the feature that results in the largest information gain (or another similar criterion). The goal is to create branches that lead to the most homogeneous (pure) subsets with respect to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: To make a prediction for a new observation, the decision tree algorithm starts at the root of the tree and moves through the nodes, following the branches corresponding to the features of the observation, until it reaches a leaf node. The class label of the leaf node is the prediction.\n",
